# Text Categorization Model

This code implements a text categorization model using TensorFlow. The model is trained to classify text into different categories. Here is a brief overview of the code:

**1. Data Loading**: The code loads training and testing data from the specified directories using `tf.keras.preprocessing.text_dataset_from_directory`.

**2. Data Preprocessing**: The text data is preprocessed using text vectorization techniques provided by the `TextVectorization` layer. The layer tokenizes the text, removes punctuation, and converts it into integer sequences.

**3. Model Architecture**: The model architecture consists of an embedding layer, dropout layers, global average pooling, and a dense layer. The embedding layer converts the integer sequences into dense vectors, and the global average pooling layer reduces the dimensionality of the vectors. Dropout layers are included for regularization.

**4. Model Training**: The model is compiled with a loss function, optimizer, and metrics. It is then trained on the training dataset for a specified number of epochs using the `fit` function.

**5. Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset, and the loss and accuracy are calculated.

**6. Model Saving**: The model, along with the text vectorization layer, is saved for future use.

This code serves as a basic implementation of a text categorization model using TensorFlow. It can be extended and customized based on specific requirements and datasets.
